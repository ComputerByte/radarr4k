# radarr4k
Second Radarr Installation on Swizzin debian based systems

Should work on ubuntu as well, just need to change mono paths

Installs mono and Radarr, changes ports and url base to not conflict with base Radarr, adds nginx and swizzin inputs to be added to panel.

Run install.sh as sudo

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ComputerByte/radarr4k/main/install.sh

chmod +x install.sh

sudo /path/to/file/install.sh
